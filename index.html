<h3>About Me</h3>
<p title=About Elijah> Hello. I am Elijah Soria and I am currently a undergraduate student of mathematics and computer science at <a href="http://www.stmarys-ca.edu/">Saint Mary&#39;s college of California</a>, with an expected graduation date of December 2016. I grew up in Minburn, Iowa, and graduated from <a href="http://schools.wdmcs.org/valley/">West Des Moines Valley High School</a> in 2013. I have a wide range of mathematical and computational interests, including mathematical poetry, and am excited to see where my interests take me.</p>

<h3>Publications</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Some Properties of Generalized <i>k</i>-Pell Sequences</b><br></li>
<p title=kpell> The purpose of this paper is twofold; (1) to develop several identities for the Generalized <i>k</i>-Pell sequence (including those of Binet, Catalan, Cassini, and d&#39;Ocagne), and (2) to study applications of tridiagonal generating matrices for the <i>k</i>-Pell and Generalized k-Pell sequences.<br>
The resulting paper was published in The Pi Mu Epsilon Journal, Vol. 14, No. 3, pp. 205-217, 2015. Here is the link to the paper on arXiv.org: <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03035">http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03035</a>

<h3>Research</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>University of Maryland</b><br></li><br>
<i>2016 Combinatorics and Algorithms for Real Problems REU, Department of Computer Science</i>
<p> Working with Professor Jonathan Katz researching a specific method of group-based cryptography called the Algebraic Eraser. The objective of the research program is to learn, implement, attack, and develop new methods for improving the Algebraic Eraser method of cryptography, whilst gaining experience working in a professional academic setting.</p>
<li><b>Saint Mary’s College of California</b><br></li><br>
<i>2015 SMC School of Science Summer Research Program, Department of Mathematics</i>
<p> Worked with Professor Kristen Beck researching certain Pell-like recursive sequences through the use of matrix methods. I was awarded the Joseph P. McKenna Award at the end of the program, which recognizes the student with the most outstanding research project and presentation. The resulting paper can be found in the Publications section.</p>
